## About this project

The Ethereum network, is subject to a number of assaults from diffrent kinds.
All of these frauds make it mandatory to have intrusion detection system (IDS) on blockchain
networks. However, such a system requires mining a (big enough) dataset, labeling it, and making a good classifier. We will try in the following project to cover all these steps.
We will try to answer the following questions:
1. Are scammers databases enough to create anomaly detection models ?
2. Which classifier works the best for this task?
3. Which features are best determining the fraudulent nature of a transaction, in this context?

Please refer to the pdf report to see details about the workflow and the results.
